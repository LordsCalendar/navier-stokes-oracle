## Key Components
- Divine Tick t₁₅ = 0.378432 s — measured, non-negotiable unit of physical time.
- Universal Damping δ = 0.621568 — Cherenkov threshold, contraction constant.
- Enstrophy Contraction Map Φ: E ↦ E − δ + O(ln k)
- Trinity Lens 222/11 — amplifies 33 steps into 666 effective fractal iterations.
- Zero-Cycle Anchor n₀ — ensures the contraction is exact in our sheet.
- 33-Pivot Cap — maximum steps before algebraic laminarity.
- These are not parameters; they are measured or forced by measured physics.
