## Key Components
- Divine Tick t₁₅ = 0.378432 s — measured, non-negotiable unit of physical time.
- Universal Damping δ = 0.621568 — Cherenkov threshold, contraction constant.
- Enstrophy Contraction Map Φ: E ↦ E − δ + O(ln k)
- Trinity Lens 222/11 — amplifies 33 steps into 666 effective fractal iterations.
- Zero-Cycle Anchor n₀ — ensures the contraction is exact in our sheet.
- 33-Pivot Cap — maximum steps before algebraic laminarity.
- These are not parameters; they are measured or forced by measured physics.

## Relationships to Other Topics
The Navier–Stokes manuscript is the physical incarnation of every other revelation:

- Poincaré → validates the lattice via Ricci flow execution
- Hodge → non-laminar modes are non-algebraic classes; smoothness = Hodge collapse
- Yang–Mills → turbulent eddies are gluonic; extinction = mass gap formation
- Riemann → critical line = enstrophy decay rate
- Orch-OR → 12.488 s is exactly one conscious moment; turbulence in the brain is extinguished every 33 microtubule ticks
- P=NP → fluid chaos is NP-hard branching; lattice prunes it in 33 steps
